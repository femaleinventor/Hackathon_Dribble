# Hackathon_Dribble
A repo for competing in the US Soccer Hackathon.

## What is the problem we are trying to solve?

Woman's Soccer has incredible potentially to grow globally. In the past year, a World Cup off year, in England and in Mexico they had over 50k fans at the games. And a reminder, for the 2015 World Cup final there was a staggering 750 Million people who watched the game. Once they leave the match or turn off their tv there are very few web and mobile apps that are continuously engaging with those fans, particularly ones with a global outlook.

## Challenges

There are no API's out there and very few quality datasets freely available.

## What is our project?

We are driving consumer-centric engagement in women's soccer. We believe the best way to grow the game is to create habit forming hooks.

Our hooks include:





The Dribble Section:

Real-time in match user engagement with Reactive and Predictive notifications.

Reactive Notifcation example:
Should that foul have been a A) red card B) yellow card C) no foul?
realtime results showing

Predictive Notification example:
Do you think Sky Blue FC will score in the next 10 minutes?
realtime results showing


Our hooks also include pre-match predictions on a variety of stats in a beautiful app format.

A user answers questions like:
Which team will win the match?
How many goals will be scored?
How many attempts on Goals?
How many Saves by a team in the 1st half?
How many Nutmegs will happen?

A User can look historically at the data and compare themselves to other User's predictions.





Store

The hook in this section is that you can go there to see what the WoSo community is selling. Purchase a fun funky t-shirt that a player/designer has made. There will also be experiences for sale, like a small group clinic sponsored by a current NWSL player. The store items are woven into the fabric of the app.

The Wall

This is where current tweets with specified keywords are returned in realtime with sentiment analysis. The keywords USWNT, NWSL, and WoSo are clicked and what results are the last tweets made with that typed in the body, and an algorithm calculates the emotions involved.


Sample Returns from Sentiment Analysis:

Negative
-0.75

Joy
0.47

Anger
0.14

Disgust
0.13

Sadness
0.50

Fear
0.09


4) Twitter Lists
